**Alternate Forms:** randomized stimuli

**Languages:** English (instructions only, rest of task accessible for any language using Latin script)

**Validation:** not available

**Accessibility:** colourblind-friendly

**Platforms:** fMRI, EEG, offline

**Devices:** PC

**Species:** human

## Development
**Software:** NBS Presentation (version 17)

**Requirements:** two-button response device

## Administration

Run this task using NBS Presentation.

## Procedure and Conditions

This task includes an experimental session (40 trials) for either fMRI or EEG/offline use. The stimuli are randomized so a practice session can be run using the EEG/offline for any modality and may be ended prematurely once the participant has understood the task. Each trial displays a string of consonants (4 or 6 letters) followed by a delay (4 seconds), followed by a probe letter. Participants responded with one or the other button to indicate (yes/no) whether the probe was presented in the previous string. Inter-trial intervals are jittered between 2 and 12 seconds.

## Output Files

Log files are output to calculate event timing.

## Scoring

- number of correct responses
- reaction time
